## First of all
This is a rudimentary template, please submit any fixes and or improvements you can find to the pull request. 

## Steps to make work. (1-6)
1. Make a generic template.
2. Replace said GenericModule.kvp content's with the Squad Module contents.
3. Restart the instance for the Generic Module
4. Login and update the instance making sure it downloads via SteamCMD anonymous (Which it should)
5. Start the instance once it is downloaded and run it and you should be able to connect, modify any files you need to in /squadgame/403240/SquadGame/ServerConfig/
6. (Un-needed step which i shouldn't need to say, but make sure to restart once you make any modifications within the ServerConfig Directory)
